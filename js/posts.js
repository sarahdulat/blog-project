It's an array of arrays, or dictionaries that have basic key: value pairs that you can call to and compile in your web application.</p><p>Also, doesn't JSON sound like a really geeky rap name?</p>",

Trickery of the mind! We workshopped a digital clock and a stopwatch in class this week that had the FOUC problem, so even something as small as that isn't safe from the FOUC.</p><p>We also went over algorithms, which are code functions written out in plain english.

    copy: "<p>iPhone apps used to be built in a language called Objective-C, which javascript and many other languages are based on. In come Apple, trying to make things easier again (and failing) by writing a new langauge called Swift to code their apps in. Having their own language for their native apps reduces human error and lowers the barrier for entry by normalizing the codebases. I see it as another language and syntax to learn, but I guess it makes it easier on their end to get apps through their strict approvals process. Swift looks a lot like Javascript but different enough to trip you up.</p>",

I really dislike xCode, it is a frumpy program that does 70% of what it could do, Apple should be ashamed. Either way I still learned a lot about the building blocks of an iOs app and how it gets compiled. The Frameworks Foundation is very helpful to get the basic tasks of an app up and running so you can focus on what makes your app unique. We went very quickyl through some of the basics of setting up a new project and how the storyboard and view controllers work together to give you many options for coding your app. Smoke was coming out of my ears.</p>",

    copy: "<p>I am learning that there are so many layers to every programming language. It's never just one set of syntax you need to get used to, because someone out there wrote another language to make the previous one easier. Or something like that. jQuery is in my eyes, a javascript library that can expedite some code writing for you, but really it's just another thing to think about and link to your code. Ao much to learn.</p><p>Another way to make your life easier is so link a CSS reset to your code. Every browser has it's own standard css that your code then sits on and that can mess up your calculations. Just reset it to zero so you know what you're working with when soemthing won't align correctly.</p>",

Not much else to say on that topic since they are very simple to integrate into my current knowledge.</p><p>We explored GitHub a little bit, still a mystery to me but it's one of those things I need to start using to learn. I see the benefit of branching when working on a team, but it still freaks me out.</p><p>Ah Javascript, we meet again. Again this is something I have tinkered with over the years, mostly copying and pasting into the right spots to get some interactive element going. But writing it from scratch has always looked scary and mathy. We were introduced to the DOM and some basic syntax like the different data types and logic. I'm a very logical person, but javascript seems to use logic as a weapon.</p><p>This week I also decided to sign up for a Swift + xCode workshop with a meetup called Girl Develop It. My friends Briana and Frances are coming with me, which should be interesting since they have no programming backgrounds!</p>",

Terminal is super scary and makes me think I am going to break my computer (and apparently there is a code to completely brick your hard drive if you wanted to!), but it is an essential part to the programmers workflow.</p><p>A lot of the CSS stuff was very familiar to me, I've been tinkering around with that for 15 years now, but one piece of code changed my whole life: <span>box-sizing: border-box;</span>. So simple, so life changing. With this you no longer have to calculate the size of your element or it's margins and padding, it just makes it all fit into a neat little box! Display types and positioning were finally demystified, I had been feeling around in the dark around those for a while now.</p><p>Another thing I got demystified this week was Git. Well actually I still have no idea how it works but I can tell you it versions your code so you don't lose your work. I have so many questions though, where do the images go? Do I not need to FTP things anymore? My designer self is confused, where it is going? The cloud? Help?</p>",

With this feature I can see predicted job salaries for positions and where my resume stacks up against other applicants. This proved to be very disheartening as my field and chosen career appear to have been reduced to glorified powerpoint designers that make less than I do now (which is not a lot). Without some new skills I was going to be stuck here forever doing grunt production design until they outsourced us to India like they did with IT, accounting and customer service.</p><p>This is where NYCDA comes in. They ahd the perfect program, at the perfect price at the perfect location. I taught myself how to code HTML and CSS when I was 14 making websites for my Petz game in geocities (cringe). Since then I had gotten seduced by the glamour of graphic design a dn illustration, which was a completely plausible career choice until Steve Jobs came along with his iPad creationa dn destroyed the publication industry. Not like I blame him, but it kind of changed the game.</p><p>So here I am, back in school and gearing up to re-learn everything to todays standards so I can become hirable again. Wish me luck.</p>",

Glen goes in hard and dirty on the dirt behind one of the most disastrous and expensive musicals ever, Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark. I’m only a few dozen pages in but by the pace and name dropping (Bono!) thus far it is going to be a good read. Highly recommended to any and all, even if you aren’t a theater buff.</p><p>So far I’ve gotten through the backstory before the shit hit the fan, and it’s funny how there were some signs and warnings that are only clear now after the fact, but there were also moments where it seemed like they were riding a wave of creative genius. There is no way to tell what venture is going to work out, ain’t it fun?!</p>",

Actually I know why, I have been forcing myself to figure out what I want to do with my life and reading a lot of varied books to spark some sort of passion. Last thing I was reading was Biology for Dummies because medicine had always been an interest of mine and I thought I’d peek into what that would entail. Sounds silly I know. What I have done instead is apply to volunteer at NYP which is right outside my apartment to see if that is something I’d be interested in. Probably better than reading about DNA and the process of mitosis vs meiosis.</p><p>I’m only a few chapters in but it is so entertaining and quite possibly could help me figure out what I want to do for the rest of my life anyway. It had always been a battle between arts and sciences and eight years ago, the arts won. But maybe I had chosen the wrong kind of art? Who knows.</p><p>Amy though, a woman of my own heart and fellow Virgo (9/16) knows exactly what’s up. Come on Amy, give me a sign!</p>",
